      <p class="bio">I'm a graduate from the University of Oklahoma. Boomer Sooner! There I double majored in Finance and Entrepreneurship. I have a passion for creating things and flexing my entrepreneurial muscle. My finance background led me to a career as a loan officer. Being a loan officer allows me to utilize my finance degree and entrepreneurial spirit. I have been in the indsutry as a loan officer for about 4.5 years. I've had success in my company as a top producer in the company.</p>

      <p class="bio">In 2013, I got involved with a start up called iPal. iPal is a cutting edge technology hardware startup focused on wearable smartglasses. I have been involved in the marketing and business development side since then. I have raised seed money from friends/family/angel investors. I was also part of a successful Indiegogo crowd funding campaign in which we exceeded our goal and raised $100,000.<p/>

      <p class="bio">My ultimate goal is to utilize my new coding skills to further along the product roadmap of our product.</p>
